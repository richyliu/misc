            <p>
                For years our troop has been using outdated technology for our
                website. It has been mostly unchanged since it first launched
                back in 2006 with the help of Perry Ting. Although it has
                recieved many small updates over the years, it was clearly
                lagging behind in terms of clarity, usability, and beauty.
            </p>

            <p>
                The brand new troop website will be released in July of 2016,
                featuring a brand new look based on industrial standards
                (Bootstrap 3) as well as updated information. The website will
                no longer be a non-functional, static piece of "furniture", but
                instead will revolutionize the way our troop communicates.
            </p>
            
            <h2 class="section-heading">The Many Features</h2>

            <p>
                The most exciting feature the new troop website will deliver is
                a searchable, offline directory. This will help scouts and
                parents find each other more effectively, instead of searching
                through old emails.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The website will also include a calendar, where scouts and
                parents can view future events and plan accordingly. Calendars
                can only be edited by admins to ensure that the information is
                up to date and accurate.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                In addition, the website will include many pages of information
                to help younger scouts know the ins and outs of our troop. It
                will contain information to help new scouts join, the ranking
                system, as well as current troop jobs.
            </p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Planned Feature</h2>

            <p>
                In order to release the troop website as quickly as possible, we
                had to leave out many helpful features, such as offline web app,
                event pages, and a login system.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Event pages are slated to be released in January of 2017. It
                will allow SiC to edit a web page and publish information such
                as the location of a campout, headcounts, and agendas. This New
                technology will radically change the way our troop communicates.
                Instead of digging through old emails, looking for headcounts
                spreadsheets, campount locations, or updated agendas, scouts and
                parents can simply check the event page.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Offline web apps are currently in development and should be
                released in July of 2016. Offline web apps will allow scouts and
                parents to view directory and event pages information while
                offline. It will also be integrated to appear just like an app
                downloaded from the app store. It will only support
                iOS<sup>TM</sup> initially. Details Android<sup>TM</sup> support
                will be announced later this year.
            </p>
