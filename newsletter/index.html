                        <h2>Introducing the T485 Monthly Newsletter</h2>
                        <p>
                            Some of you may wonder about what’s goes on behind the scenes in our troop.  Some of you might just want a short summary of the recent things are happening.  Maybe you’re just interested in learning something?  This newsletter is meant to serve you, a member of our community, and inform you about some of the developments of our ever-improving troop.  Our troop is all the more excellent when everybody is on the same page—this newsletter will bring us one step closer to that.
                        </p>
                        
                        <h2>What happened to Bearpaw? </h2>
                        <p>
                            The low levels of snow this year has forced our troop to cancel many iconic winter activities, such as BearPaw. BearPaw is an activity organised by the Silicon Valley Monterey Bay Council located in Cisco Grove, CA each year. Participants of BearPaw build a snow shelter and spend the night in it. However, due to the low amounts of snow, our troop will not be going to BearPaw this year.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It was put to a vote at a recent Patrol Leaders Council, and the backup option won by 9 votes to 7.  Although BearPaw has been cancelled, we will still go to a campout on that day. SiCs Glen Chen and Samuel Wong have planned a backup campout to Point Reyes National Seashore, a coastal geological abnormality just north of the Golden Gate. Campsites in the park have filled up, so instead we will be camping at Samuel Taylor State Park.  
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            You may be interested in how much snow have we been getting this year, and whether it is really bad enough to cancel BearPaw. <a href="https://cdec.water.ca.gov/cgi-progs/products/PLOT_SWC.pdf">Here</a> is a chart showing precipitation for northern, central, and southern California, compared to several other years.

                        <h2>New adventures: April Backpacking</h2>
                        <p>
                            To my knowledge, the troop has never gone on a backpacking trip for longer than 3 days, with the exception of high adventure trips.  While this may seem daunting, it should give you cause for excitement (and joy, if you’re that kind of person).  Weather and snow permitting, our troop will send 1-2 crews to the Yosemite wilderness, both headed on 25-35 mile treks on trails with some of the best mountain peaks and alpine lakes that California has to offer.  The hiking will be tiresome and the days will be hard, but the difficulties we face will only serve to test the strength of our character, the durability of our comradeship, and the intensity of our passion.  I’m sorry not everybody could sign up due to the unwieldy date, but to everybody who could, it’s going to be good.
                        </p>
